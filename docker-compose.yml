#    environment: 
#     - SERVER=add.your.irc.server
#     - NICK=LamestBot
### Make this match your listen setting in the config
    ports:
     - "3333:3333"

    volumes:
     - /changethispart/data/:/home/eggdrop/eggdrop/data/
### If you want to add scripts, put them here. Don't mount to /scripts because
### it will overwrite the ones that are already used. Make sure you use 
### 'source scripts2/foo.tcl' as the path in the config.
#     - /changethispart/scripts:/home/eggdrop/eggdrop/scripts2
